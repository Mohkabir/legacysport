          Definition: [
            'Continuous Bounce: Dribbling involves continuously bouncing the ball with one hand while moving around the court. This skill allows players to evade defenders, find open teammates, and create scoring opportunities.',
          ],
          Rules: [
            'Single Hand: Players must use only one hand to dribble the ball at a time. They can switch hands but cannot touch the ball simultaneously with both hands or carry it (palming).',
            'Movement: Dribbling allows players to move with the ball, but if they stop dribbling (except for the designated point guard), they must either pass, shoot, or start dribbling again before taking another step.',
          ],
          Violations: [
            'Dribbling violations in basketball occur when players fail to adhere to specific rules governing ball handling while dribbling. Understanding these violations is crucial for players to avoid turnovers and maintain possession for their team.',

          'Double Dribble': [
            'Definition: Double dribble occurs when a player dribbles the ball with both hands simultaneously or stops dribbling and then resumes dribbling again. It results in a turnover, and possession is awarded to the opposing team.',
            'Example: A player dribbles the ball, stops to pick it up, and then dribbles again without passing or shooting. This action constitutes a double dribble violation.',
          ],
          'Carrying (Palming)': [
            "Definition: Carrying, or palming, occurs when a player's hand is under the ball while dribbling, giving them undue advantage in controlling the ball. It results in a turnover, and possession is given to the opposing team.",
            'Example: A player dribbles the ball with their palm under it, making it appear as if they are carrying or holding the ball rather than bouncing it.',
          ],
          'Traveling (Walking)': [
            'Definition: Traveling, also known as walking, happens when a player moves one or both feet illegally without dribbling the ball. It results in a turnover, and possession is awarded to the opposing team.',
            'Example: A player takes more than two steps without dribbling the ball or moves their pivot foot illegally while holding the ball.',
          ],
          Techniques: [
            'Dribbling is not just about bouncing the ball; it involves mastering various techniques to navigate through defenders, maintain control, and create scoring opportunities.',
          ],
          'Control and Speed': [
            'Hand Position: Keep your hand on top of the ball while dribbling, using your fingertips to control its bounce and direction.',
            'Low Dribble: Dribble the ball close to the ground to make it harder for defenders to steal.',
            'Change of Pace: Vary your dribbling speed to keep defenders guessing. Start slow to control the ball and accelerate to blow past defenders.',
          ],
          'Moves and Techniques': [
            ' Crossover: A quick dribble switch from one hand to the other. This move is effective for changing direction and creating space between you and the defender.',
            'Behind the Back: Dribble the ball behind your back to protect it from defenders while changing direction.',
            'Between the Legs: Dribble the ball between your legs to maintain control and move around defenders.',
            'Spin Move: Execute a quick spin while dribbling to evade a defender and drive towards the basket.',
          ],
          'Protection and Awareness': [
            'Body Positioning: Use your body to shield the ball from defenders. Keep your non-dribbling hand up to fend off defenders and create space.',
            'Court Awareness: Keep your head up while dribbling to see open teammates, anticipate defensive moves, and make quick decisions.',
          ],
          'Practice and Application': [
            'Dribbling Drills: Practice dribbling drills to improve your ball-handling skills. Focus on control, speed, and executing different dribbling techniques.',

          ],
          'Team Fouls': [
            'Team fouls are cumulative fouls committed by a team within a specified period (usually a quarter or half). Once a team reaches a certain number of team fouls (usually 5 or more), the opposing team enters the bonus situation, where free throws are awarded for subsequent fouls.',
            'Penalty: In the bonus situation, the opposing team shoots free throws regardless of whether the foul was committed on a shooting play or not.',
          ],
          'Unsportsmanlike Conduct': [
            'Definition: Actions that are contrary to the spirit of sportsmanship and fair play, such as taunting, trash-talking, or intentional provocation of opponents, can result in fouls categorized as unsportsmanlike conduct.',
